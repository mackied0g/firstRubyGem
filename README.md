# Thanks for stopping by, friend!

This is a fun project I started October 8th, 2019, on my train ride into school. As a new Rubyist and someone passionate about Open Source Software, I thought this would be a great way to teach basic Ruby concepts and promote open source contributions.

This is my first Ruby gem I have ever created. I learned how to make a Ruby Gem from a website, Dev.to, where I followed basic instructions and made it my own.

### What does it do? 

It's a fun way to bundle ASCII artwork into your backend Ruby files. This gem is lightweight and doesn't take up much memory or speed at all. This is more of a portal for new and seasoned Rubyists alike to participate in an Open Source project in a lighthearted, creative, fun way.
