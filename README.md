# Thanks for stopping by, friend!

This is a fun project I started October 8th, 2019, on my train ride into school. As a new Rubyist and someone passionate about Open Source Software, I thought this would be a great way to teach basic Ruby concepts and promote open source contributions.

### What does it do? 

It's a fun way to bundle ASCII artwork into your backend Ruby files. This gem is lightweight and doesn't take up much memory or speed at all.
